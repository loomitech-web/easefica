                text : '<h4>The FICA does not give you blanket cover to collect information about your clients without consent.</h4> <br><p>Particular areas where caution is advised are when you make use of commercially available lists e.g. adverse media, where you engage in Enhanced Due Diligence, where you make enquiries about the nature of your client’s business and also, the conclusions you draw regarding the client’s risk profile. It is advisable to make reference to the nature and purpose of any such information collected in your POPIA disclosures and to obtain consent from the client.</p><p>Let’s start with the POPIA as it provides the framework:</p><p>Section 6 provides for exclusions and reads in part as follows:</p><p>“(1)	This Act does not apply to the processing of personal information – </p><p>by or on behalf of a public body – </p><ul><li>which involves national security, including activities that are aimed at assisting in the identification of the financing of terrorist and related activities, defense or public safety; or  </li><li>the purpose of which is the prevention, detection, including assistance in the identification of the proceeds of unlawful activities and the combatting of money laundering activities, investigation or proof of offences, the prosecution of offenders or the execution of sentences or security measures, to the extent that adequate safeguards have been established in legislation for the protection of such personal information;</li></ul></p><p>The first question to consider is whether, in discharging your CDD obligations, you are acting for or on behalf of a public body? In the premise that all accountable institutions do, then it must be noted that CDD (including Enhanced Due Diligence) activities are only exempt from the POPIA to the extent that the FICA provides adequate safeguards for the protection of personal information.</p><p>To what extent does FICA provide protection of personal information? </p><ul><li>Section 60 (2) deals with misuse of information in that any person who knows, suspects or ought reasonably to have known or suspected that information has been disclosed to the FIC, or that an investigation is being conducted or contemplated based on information disclosed to the FIC and in any way brings this to the attention of any other person, is guilty of an offence.  This includes a reference to the mere fact that a report has been filed with the FIC and will include a disclosure of any personal data which comprise that report.</li><li>Section 37 effectively eliminates any confidentiality constraints pertaining to the disclosure of CDD information to the FIC or any other approved institution but excludes information obtained as part of attorney-client privilege.</li><li>Section 47 compels accountable institutions to maintain records, including CDD and transaction-related records prescribed in sections 22, 23 and 24. It is noteworthy that these sections do not prescribe the manner in which records must be kept, but rather only the purpose and periods for which they must be kept as well as authority to outsource record keeping.</li></ul></p><p>All of the above deals with the manner in which an accountable institution must deal with records once obtained, but leaves out the exact nature of information to be obtained as well as authority to in fact obtain that information. For this, we must turn to section 21 and including section 21A to H. This is the so-called Customer Due Diligence information. I will not repeat the content here, save to state that only the information provided for in these sections may be obtained from a client under the protection of the FICA. Any and all other information, regardless how good the intention with which it is obtained and processed, will be subject to the POPIA and must be dealt with accordingly. </p><p>The potential problem we have to deal with here in deciding when POPIA applies and when not really lays in interpretation for example - an AI must establish:</p><p><ul><li>The nature of the client’s business; and</li><li>The ownership and control structure of the client.</li></ul></p><p>At what point in your enquiries can it be said that you have exceeded the authority of the FICA?</p><p>Another example is with screening of clients against the UNSC lists. Section 26A and 28A respectively places either limits or an absolute prohibition on doing business with certain persons whose names appear on the prescribed lists. This is not the problem. The problem arises when you are not sure if it is your client on the list and you have to conduct further investigation by going beyond the lists. It seems reasonably clear to me that should you venture beyond the prescribed lists, you leave the authority of the FICA. (Caveat: There will and should be contrary interpretations of this premise.)  </p><p>The same issue can be raised in respect of enhanced due diligence in general. The particular problem here is that both the FICA and the guidelines issued by the FIC (Guidance note 7) are quite vague for instance: “An accountable institution’s systems and controls should provide for more information to be obtained about their clients, more secure confirmation of clients’ information to be applied and closer scrutiny to be conducted to their clients’ transaction activities where they assess the risk of abuse to be higher. This is referred to as enhanced due diligence.” Again, to my mind and subject to tolerance for contrary opinion, the safe option when conducting EDD would be to assume that the POPIA rather than the FICA applies and that it would be better to get consent in advance. FICA requirements and obligations do not give you carte blanche to conduct due diligence and draw up a risk profile of your clients without consent.</p><p>So, in summary, when you collect information about clients that is strictly prescribed e.g. identity, you are entitled to do this under the auspices of the FICA and need no consent for this. When you stray into ill-defined requirements which leave it up to the AI to determine e.g. the so-called adverse publicity and other non-prescribed commercially available lists, it would be much safer to obtain consent of the client. It is important to also remember that the POPIA does not only deal with your ability to obtain personal information, but also the processing thereof. So, it is not only about what information to collect, but also how you interpret it and put it to use. Except for reporting to the authorities, your clients have a right to ask for all of this information. </p>',

                text : '<h4>We tend to hear, but not necessarily understand...</h4> <br><p>...what the implications are when told that the FICA allows administrative sanctions of up to R50 million in the case of a juristic entity and R10 million in the case of a natural person and up to R100 million and/or 15 years imprisonment as penalties. </p><p>Generally speaking a person can be held liable for wrongdoing either criminally or in terms of civil law. If you are held liable criminally, you are charged with having committed a criminal act. If you are held liable civilly, you stand accused of having committed a wrongful act – a delict (dereliction).</p><p> Regardless of criminal or civil accountability and in most cases, there must be an element of either intentional or negligent breach before liability is established.</p><p>   <b>The FICA allows for a person to be charged criminally for non-compliance.</b> For this to be successful the State i.e. the National Prosecution Authority must bring a criminal case against the accused and if convicted, the penalties referred to above will apply. The burden of proof rests on the State and it must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Criminal prosecutions under the FICA are difficult, technical and require substantial expertise – which is why they are also rare.</p><p> In civil matters, the burden of proof also rests with the plaintiff but is set lower i.e. your case, including intent or negligence on the part of the wrongdoer must be proved on a balance of probability. Damages and awards are payable directly to the successful plaintiff by the respondent. The FICA does not provide for civil suits based on delict and it is hard to see how somebody may wish to institute an action against another for damages suffered in result of non-compliance. (There may always be the exception where compliance officers are sued by their clients though, for failure to advise them properly.)</p><p> What it does provide for though, is instead of having an institution charged criminally for non-compliance, to impose administrative sanctions.  Administrative sanctions, unlike any other form of liability, seem to be a form of strict liability in that it <b>does not require intent or negligence by the wrongdoer.</b></p><p>  All that is required for administrative sanctions to become possible is an objective breach of the compliance provisions of the FICA, regardless of whether the wrongdoer had been willful or negligent. The burden of proof rests on the FIC or its authorized supervisory body and before the sanction can be enforced, a procedure to ensure substantive fairness must be followed, including affording the wrongdoer an opportunity to make representations. The burden of proof seems to be discharged on a balance of probability although most issues on non-compliance are factual and therefore quite easy to demonstrate.</p><p>  By reference to a number of recent FIC Appeals Board decisions the presence of either negligence or willfulness, although it has no bearing on liability or guilt, play a role in determining the quantum of the sanction. By way of example, a negligent failure to report a reportable transaction will attract a fine of 10% of the size of the transaction. Gross negligence attracts fines of up to 20% of the size of the transaction and willfulness attracts the maximum fines allowed for. <b>Using the excuse of “I did not know…” was held to constitute gross negligence</b>, presumably because the FICA expressly provides for compulsory training of all staff. </p><p>Administrative sanctions are widespread and seem to be the preferred method of enforcement due to a low burden of proof, the much more manageable aspect of strict liability and the fact that subject matter experts in the form of FIC and other inspectors are in charge of the process.   Proposed amendments to schedule 1 to the FICA aim to substantially expand the range of accountable institutions whilst enforcement will be concentrated in the hands of the FIC and the FSCA – both institutions already well versed in the technicalities. This will avoid enforcement arbitrage between different sectors as, regardless of whether you are an attorney, estate agent or financial adviser; you will be inspected by one of those two, and no longer by your own regulatory body.     </p>',

                text : '<h4>THE FICA DOES NOT MAKE SUPER-INVESTIGATORS OR ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OF ORDINARY BUSINESSES.</h4> <br><p>I am often asked if it is necessary for accountable institutions (AI) to screen their clients against the various lists available (such as negative publicity, PEP and others – let’s call them Subscriber Lists (SLs)) in addition to the lists strictly prescribed by the FICA. My answer is almost always “no” and there are various reasons for this.</p><p>Let’s deal with the legal requirements first. In South Africa, AIs must perform a customer due diligence in order to identify and assess the risk that clients may be involved in money laundering or terror financing activities (TFA). TFA reporting is dealt with predominantly in section 28A of the FICA, which identifies three distinct reporting scenarios:</p><ol><li>If the AI has under its control or possession, property owned or controlled by an entity which has committed, attempted to commit of facilitated a specified offence (i.e. terrorist and related offences) as defined in the Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against Terrorist and Related Activities Act (POCDATARA); </li><li>If the entity is named in a specific list as published by the President in terms of section 25 of POCDATARA i.e. known terrorists and associates; and</li><li>If the entity’s name appears on a list published by the UN Security Council as an entity against whom targeted financial sanctions have been imposed.</li></ol><br><p>The second and third items above pose little difficulty because there are names which appear on published lists and a bit of common sense will allow an AI to discern whether its client is such a person.  If for instance, a person’s second and third names correspond with a name on a list, it would be reasonable to eliminate the possibility that it is the same client. Please note that the requirement is not that the AI must have absolute certainty, but that it should have reasonable certainty. If say, three out of four names correspond, including e.g. the surname, the AI must determine whether it has reasonable certainty based on the information at hand. If it has, then the report must be made and the legally prescribed consequences must follow. If it has not, then the AI must decide whether it will continue business with that client or whether it will first complete an enhanced due diligence on the client. The approach must be described in the Risk Management and Compliance Program of the AI. It would appear that the requirement for reasonable certainty may be a moving target which is influenced by amongst others, the experience, qualifications, collective corporate wisdom and resources at the disposal of the AI. It is in these cases, to my mind, where SLs might be accessed as part of a prescribed enhanced due diligence procedure, although access to SLs is not prescribed in any way, shape or form as either standard operating procedure for standard CDD or EDD. In fact, making such comparisons as part of standard CDD brings with it a whole new set of problems further discussed below.</p><p>Item 1 above is problematic from a number of perspectives: how would an AI know if a person has committed, attempted to commit or facilitated a TFA without comparing to (a) list(s) of sorts? Surely to expect an AI to compile and maintain its own database of terrorist accused worldwide would transcend the demands of reasonableness?  The requirement seems to push AIs in the direction of consulting lists – but which lists? We can distinguish here between the so-called SLs, which are published and maintained by private enterprises for profit, or lists maintained and prepared by non-profit international institutions such as the United Nations Security Council. In addition, there are also lists maintained by individual countries.</p><p>It has become common practice in South Africa to draw on the integrated lists of known terrorists and associates published by the UNSC – the so-called ISIL (Al-Qaida) lists. I submit that in the ordinary course and subject to the caveat discussed below, these would suffice for meeting the reasonableness demand. They are in the public domain, not for profit and freely accessible via the internet.</p><p>Lists published by individual countries may be regarded as partisan and in many instances, are compiled with political objectives in mind. It is doubtful whether such lists ought to be relied on for our purposes.</p><p>Lists maintained for profit tend to draw on multiple sources to which an algorithm is applied. In a very insightful  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/blacklist-muslims-listed-world-check-evidence-191022115529354.html" target="_blank">article on Al-Jazeera</a>, various pitfalls regarding such lists are discussed. Criticisms range from anti-Muslim bias, which then favours other extremist groups that might also legitimately be seen as terrorist groups to reliance on doubtful sources. The message is clear – a responsible AI should not blindly rely on the results obtained from such lists and would be well advised to conduct further independent investigation. This brings me to the next issue – one of resources.</p><p>It is understandable that an AI may wish to access as many lists as possible in the course of conducting enhanced due diligence because these may be relatively few and far between. The additional demands made on investigative resources and time may be well justified here. To rely on these lists as standard operating procedure in the course of standard due diligence seems to me to be wasteful and fraught with additional risks, not least of which is that a potential client may suffer irreparable harm if it were to become known that an account had been declined based on such information – if taken at face value. There are prohibitions in the act to prevent this type of information from being made public, but if untrue, it will always find a way out and into the public domain.</p><p>In summary then, reliance on country-specific lists is problematic because they may be influenced by political considerations. Reliance of UNSC lists is regarded as adequate but they may suffer from a post 9/11 bias against certain groups. Reliance on commercially available subscription lists, according to Al Jazeera may prove risky due to the variety of sources, including some doubtful ones used. Recognising the inherent risks whilst using such lists must of necessity add a substantial layer of cost in consequence of a due diligence having to be performed on the sources as well. If you have the resources and clients who are willing to ultimately absorb the cost, well and good, but such an approach may well go beyond the demands of reasonableness. </p><p>The eas-e Fica™ customer due diligence and risk rating software interrogates the UNSC and other legally prescribed lists as our minimum value proposition. This is reflected in our pricing structure and renders our solution imminently affordable to small and medium enterprises. We can effortlessly link to other lists based on our clients’ requirements, subject to the caveats above. </p>',

                text : '<h4>South Africa is losing the fight on corruption according to Shamila Bathoi, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and Government has declared war on fraud and corruption</h4> <br><p>It is therefore in our national interest that we do what we can to help. By combatting organized crime – one of the main targets of anti-money laundering - we are making a direct contribution to the well-being of our society. When we do so because we want to do the right thing instead of merely because we have to, it makes a substantial qualitative difference and gives us a sense of having done something meaningful.</p><p>My general argument why anti-money laundering distinguishes itself ethically (i.e. the right thing to do) goes as follows: Culture is the most valuable contributor to our perception of ethics i.e. how we ought to live our lives in order to derive some sense of meaning. Although culture comprises many aspects and icons, not all contribute equally to our ethics. Here, most important are our values. Values shape beliefs and beliefs inform attitude. When our attitude shapes our behavior, the closer we are with our values and, it is said, the more moral and the more pleasant our society. Since even before ancient Greek times and in many cultures, to live in and contribute to such a society was said to be the greatest good. Other cultural icons by comparison, play a far lesser role.</p><p> Behaviour can be determined through values, customs and norms. Generally what distinguishes values and custom from norms is that the corresponding behaviours are voluntary – whereas norms (taken here strictly as legal and compliance imperatives) are usually associated with prescriptions and penalties to keep them in place. Values are formed through a combination of things: they must be generally accepted, widely held and constantly reinforced. It does happen that legislation and compliance requirements assume the nature of values when these three components are present, but not always.</p><p> In modern, complicated times, the chances that regulations correspond with broader society’s values are few and far between. Increasingly, regulation is used as an instrument to enforce somebody else’s view of what ought to be. When this happens, adhering to compliance is not voluntary for the sake of the greater good, but a “tick-box” exercise for self-preservation. When regulatory requirements match the shared values of society, compliance becomes an ethical act because one willingly participates for the sake of those values. So, to speak about a culture of compliance does not automatically elevate compliance to ethics. It can as easily become a corporate cultural icon of simply and unquestioningly obeying the rules for the sake of avoiding sanctions.</p><p> Combatting money laundering is a complex and massive endeavor which can only be successful if executed on an international scale according to uniform standards. The main aim of anti-money laundering is to make it difficult for organized criminals to enjoy the proceeds of their crimes. It stands to reason that success here will serve to reduce the instances of drug and weapons smuggling, poaching, terrorism, human trafficking and child prostitution. These are noble objectives which can scarcely be said not to form an integral part of any society’s value system. The regulatory environment is consistent with the preservation of these values as embodied in the long title of the Financial Intelligence Centre act: “To establish a Financial Intelligence Centre in order to combat money laundering activities and the financing of terrorist and related activities”; and therefore, to comply will be consistent with acting ethically. In fact, due to the scope and magnitude of the international efforts to combat money laundering, compliance is just about the only way in which the average business can make a contribution to this fight. It is one of those instances where it is the right thing to do, and worth doing to the best of your ability. </p>',

Legal enforcement means you get criminally charged if you participate in money laundering/terrorist financing as defined in the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA) and the Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against Terrorist and Related Activities Act (POCDATARA) and compliance enforcement means you get fined if you don’t comply with the requirements of the Financial Intelligence Act (FICA).</p>',

The last of these was the requirement to perform Customer Due Diligence on clients in order to arrive at a risk assessment.</p> <p>The first tranche of clients that had to be assessed were clients taken on between 01 April 2017 and 01 April 2019. These clients had to be assessed by 01 April 2019. Thereafter, the FIC allowed a reasonable time period for the assessment of all other (older) clients, provided that the institution had a programme which was described in its RMCP.</p><p> The effect of this PCC is that the regulators are of the view that this latter time period has now also expired and that enforcement measures will be applied forthwith should any institution not have fully complied with the requirements.</p><p>This means that all the institution’s clients with whom it still maintains a business relationship must have been assessed in terms of the new CDD criteria, risk-rated, risks mitigated and procedures adopted for the maintenance and on-going management of all client data subject to change.</p><p>THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE eas-e Fica™ SOLUTION OFFERS.

Yet, we manage because we draw on something deep inside ourselves – an inexplicable intuition of sorts. The source of this “intuition” is generally regarded as either a deity or man-made. The first approach requires belief without evidence whilst the second defies belief without evidence. Businesses in South Africa must exhibit the values of fairness, transparency, responsibility and accountability. This is impossible in ethics shaped by belief without evidence. Only a knowledge-based approach to ethics can achieve this, but it does not happen automatically. </p><p>Three factors combine:  First, we must keep the origins of ethics simple. Ethics originated some 5000 years ago with the advent of agrarian societies and the establishment of larger villages and cities. Humans had won the initial battle against survival and started asking questions about the meaning of life, and, in the absence of answers, about ways to live meaningful lives. Also, we needed to find ways to work and live together in harmony in larger groups. These questions combine to form the seedbed for political, legal and ethical systems. Ethics are answers to questions about how to derive meaning from the way we live life whilst making a contribution to (or at least not harm) the society in which we live. This is true about businesses too.</p><p>The second major factor is one which distinguishes business ethics from other forms of ethics. Unlike the meaning of life, which is unanswerable, the purpose of the business is known. This provides employees with a backdrop against which to measure their actions. Business ethics need not suffer from the lack of clarity brought about by uncertainties in personal ethics. </p><p>Third: Major philosophical and neuro-scientific advances are being made in our understanding of consciousness - that which regulates our perceptions about ourselves and enables us to make those calls about good and bad.  These advances have removed much of the myth surrounding the topic. Our capacity for empathy, which is seen as the foundation of ethical awareness, develops from roughly our 2nd and 3rd years to our 7th year and contains two further stages. During our first few years, we are almost exclusively preoccupied with following our survival instincts – an important one in humans manifesting as eagerness to please. </p><p>Our consciousness is not a mysterious power implanted in us, and neither is our sense of right and wrong. Our earliest impressions of right and wrong are functions of our survival instincts and our eagerness to please. Because they are first, it is hard to isolate them for what they are, but they are merely transmissions of the earliest approvals and disapprovals we encountered as babies. We owe it to ourselves to constantly challenge these deep-seated premises on which we base major life decisions without question.</p><p>The modern day business environment does not tolerate an approach to ethics rooted in myth. The requirement for accountability and responsibility places an obligation on business people to stay at the cutting edge of knowledge, including the advances discussed here. Business ethics has a lot going for it - it’s role and application can be clear provided the origins are understood. It can be free of ambiguity provided the business has a clear and palatable purpose. It must be recognized as a function of human endeavor and not shrouded in mysticism. </p>',
